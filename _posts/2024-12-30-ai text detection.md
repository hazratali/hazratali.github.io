# A Simple Test to Evaluate AI Text Detection Tools

I’m often asked, “What’s a reliable tool for determining the authenticity of AI text detection?” In other words, can you trust a tool that claims to detect AI-generated text?

Here’s a straightforward exercise to answer that:
Take a paper you’ve written yourself—one you know is entirely human-authored—and run it through the detection tool. Observe the results.
This simple experiment can reveal the tool’s accuracy and reliability better than any claim or review. Try it and judge for yourself.

> One specific case study: Imagine the writing styles of special individuals (say, those with autism) who might write in a specific way, and the tool can still detect it as AI-generated text.
