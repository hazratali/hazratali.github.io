I had the privilege of delivering a seminar talk titled **Revisiting the Pitfalls in AI** at the [SID Lab, University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Peshawar](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sidlabuet/). The session was an incredible opportunity to connect with a vibrant audience of students, faculty, and AI enthusiasts, sharing a passion for exploring the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence.

The talk focused on exploring the challenges, failures, and ethical dilemmas in AI and highlighted the ethical considerations, biases in data, interpretability issues, and the impact of AI on society. Together, we discussed how researchers and practitioners can navigate these complexities to ensure AI develops responsibly and inclusively. It was a pleasure talking to an international audience as the talk was attending by faculty members, students, and online international audiences from the UK, Italy, and South Korea.

The enthusiasm of the audience was truly inspiring. Thought-provoking questions and comments highlighted their deep curiosity and understanding of the field. The interactive discussion following the presentation was the part I liked the most, as it allowed us to exchange ideas and debate critical issues.

Such fruitful engagements reaffirm the importance of fostering collaborative conversations around AI and its impact. I am grateful to the organizers at UET Peshawar for hosting this event and to the audience for their active participation and enthusiasm. Together, let’s continue exploring how AI can be developed as a tool for positive change, mindful of the ethical and technical hurdles that lie ahead.
